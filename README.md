## Notes

### Testing

I wasn't quite sure how to use some of the testing tools that come baked in with angular so i just wrote my own set of minimal tests that run when the component is loaded.

### TypeScript

When generating the app, I used strict typing. I mostly avoided defining any types at all due to time contraints.

### Input Formats

Inputs aren't validated at all, the State input isn't a drop down and there is no country selection for address.
